## Classification problems

### Occupacny data

Occupancy: This is a binary classification problem. The target feature 'Occupancy' shows whether there are one or more people in a room (0 for not occupied, 1 for occupied). So the goal is to predict occupancy state based on various features. In this notebook, I try to show  **logical flow for producing new features** rather than select them by rote. The dataset is from  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+).
